What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
1) This Git repository is used to share code with you in such a way that you can view my progress after each git commit and git push. The repository is private and only available for the two of us to view, to avoid class plagiarism. If you wanted, you could pull all of the code I have written, edit the code, and push it to the Git repository so that we could simultaneously be working on the same thing. We can both work remotely and then push to the repository, where there is one master source that we can work from.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
2) I liked Assignment 2 the best. I enjoyed working with the Google Maps API and creating something that I found useful in my own life. I also enjoyed getting to play around with the client-side visuals and interactions. I have found that I don't really enjoy working server side, as necessary as it is to understand.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
3) I have grown and learned a lot about how the web worked. Prior to this course, I know that 'stuff' making up webpages consisted of some HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code, though that was about it. I didn't know anything about HTTP requests and responses, client vs. server side, databases and how they interact with client and server side frameworks, or just anything really about how the web worked. I also had no basic knowledge of web security. I took web browsers for granted and never understood the processes that go on behind typing in a URL and hitting 'Enter'. I've learned a lot about the Web and I really enjoyed this class!

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
4) I learned that user input is scary and should never be trusted! Users can use cross-site scripting inputs that can cause all kinds of problems if not properly accounted for. This can lead to all kinds of security issues such as page redirects, taking control of a person's account, and inserting other malicious code into a web browser. Therefore, it is important to never trust user input. (Which is ironic, because you are technically designing for the user, but you should never trust the user)


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
5) I would like to delve deeper into front-end design and learn more about CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. I really enjoy playing with visuals and would like to spend more time on my own learning the different types of things I can play around with there.
