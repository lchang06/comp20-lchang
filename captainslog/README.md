Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

1) All aspects of lab specified in the spec are correctly implemented to my knowledge.

2) I had help from the following TA's: Michael, Matt, and Tatiana. I had an issue where my browsers would not display what was stored in my local storage. The problem is still present... we are confused.

I also used the following resources to help aid my knowledge of jQuery: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/979662/how-to-detect-pressing-enter-on-keyboard-using-jquery, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4088467/get-the-value-in-an-input-text-box

3) I have spent approximately 4 hours on the assignment due to my issues with the local storage display.
