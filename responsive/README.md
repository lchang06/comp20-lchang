1. I have implemented the lab such that at the breakpoints specified in the lab assignment, the respective comic strip box appears on the page. I noticed that I had trouble seeing all breakpoints when I used the Chrome web browser with the Developer Tools open (in Responsive view), but I either closed the Developer tools or used Safari all breakpoints worked as coded.

2. I did not collaborate or discuss the assignment with anyone. I used all online resources you provided and looked up other sources on CSS sprite sheets to help me complete the lab.

3. 2.5 hours
