1. Everything has been correctly implemented according to the spec, to my knowledge. If I had more time, I would have made my code cleaner and more modular.

2. I did not collaborate on this assignment. I used the following sources to help me figure things out:
	- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-geolocation
	to understand how to use geolocation and implement the Google Map on my page.

	- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/infowindow-simple
	to understand how to place a marker

	- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple
	to understand polylines

	- https://icons8.com/icon/set/train/all
	train icon source for my markers

	- https://pepsized.com/customize-your-google-map-markers/
	to understand how to populate all station markers on map

	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43800719/google-maps-computedistancebetween-not-working
	to understand how to link google geometry library in html

3. This assignment took me ~20 hours to complete (but I wasn't counting throughout...)
