1. I have correctly implemented the lyrics of We Do to syncronize with the video when played. 

2. I did not collaborate or discuss the assignment with anyone. I used the doublerainbow example in Ming's examples as a reference, and also referred to the links provided within this lab. In addition, I referenced this page to help me figure out timing in JavaScript: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/av_event_timeupdate.asp

3. I have spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment.
